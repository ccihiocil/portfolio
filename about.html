                <h3>Call from the Wilderness</h3>
                <p>Growing up in a big city in China, the wilderness in the United
                    States has attracted me. Unlike the majority of the photographers, I have zero backgrounds in arts, including drawing, painting, and filming. However, I fell in love with photography as I travel. Initially, I traveled from the west coast
                    to the east coast because I want to see myself the real America. I carefully selected the colleges and universities that I was going to attend based on its location. I chose Seattle as my first launch in the U.S because I love the Pacific
                    ocean. I later transfer to the University of Virginia because it locates at the mid-Atlantic where I can easily plan the road trips to the whole east coast. I squeezed all my spare time traveling to the North-est state: Maine and to the
                    South-est, Florida. Whatâ€™s more, during my graduation trip, I had a round-trip cross-nation road trip starting from Charlottesville, VA to Santa Monica, CA, and back, covering many states in the Central and Southern America. </p>

                        My Love towards the Nature
                    </h3>
                    <p>These journeys change me completely. I learn to admire, respect and importance of protection. I adore the natural beauty such as the rocky mountains, the Mojave desert, the Pacific oceans, and the Great Salt Lake. What I have shot are merely
                        following the wonders of nature and recorded some of the millions of its charms. For so long, the education I received told me that human could defeat nature. However, all I saw was that our ignorance and arrogance has been killing ourselves
                        slowly and steadily. Even in the breathtaking Colorado where the water seems to be crystal clear, I learned that the fish in the lake is harmful to our health since the water has been polluted by the mining industry starting decades ago.</p>

                    <h3>Photography Style</h3>
                    <p>Therefore, my photography styles also divided into two very distinct forms: the dreamy, ethereal and colorful landscape and wildlife photos; and the starker, dynamic and black-and-white images, one for enjoying, and the other for the warning.
                        Many people have forgotten what the land, the ocean, the lake, and the night sky should have looked like. They become used to living in the polluted environment and neglect the reality that the environmental issues are longer severe but
                        deadly. I wish that the peaceful images of nature can remind them of the original picture of nature, and the black-and-white photography can urge them to take actions now.

                <h3>Future</h3>
                <p>In the future, I
                    would love to apply more of what I learn as a data scientist and statistician. Using the numbers to strengthen the power of the images. I want to work with the
                    researchers, environmental scientists and the editors to collect the data, pictures, and stories on the issues related to nature, wildlife and ecological issues.
